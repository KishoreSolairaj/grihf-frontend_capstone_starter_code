# StayHealthy Medical Appointment Booking Website

## Project Overview
**StayHealthy Inc.** is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare facilities in remote areas with minimal or no medical resources. As part of its **Go Digital Initiative**, StayHealthy is building a website to help patients access doctors anytime, anywhere.  

You are assigned as a **front-end developer** to design and develop the website.

## Problem Statement
Surveys conducted by StayHealthy revealed that patients in remote areas often struggle to find doctors nearby or face long wait times, leading to life-threatening emergencies or delays in treatment. With increasing internet and broadband access, a digital solution will allow patients to consult general physicians and specialists remotely and efficiently.
